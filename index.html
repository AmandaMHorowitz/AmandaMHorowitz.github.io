			<h2>My Bio</h2>
			<br /> After studying Biochemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I began working in Biologics research for the biopharma company AbbVie. Beginning my 
					career in assay development meant spending my time solving puzzles. How many parameters could be tested in a single experiment? Could you design your assay just right to tell you whether or not your antibodies were binding only the target receptor? My next jobs, in vivo discovery and in vitro production, honed my skills of organization, project management, multitasking, and the often overlooked skill of working your way through the inevitable mountains of work. I made the jump from AbbVie to Bristol Myers Squibb, hired on as a specialist in automation for their high-throughput biologics generation team. My expertise positions me to enable upgrades to their current automation platforms and pipeline processes. Now I'm looking to transition all of the skills accumulated over the decade of my career to a new challenge: Software Engineering. Bringing with me my attention to detail, ability to work on multiple projects at once, and my love of improving the "status quo", I'm looking forward to breaking into this new world and making an impact for any team I work on.
